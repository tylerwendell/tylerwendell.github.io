# Sourdough Hamburger Buns

Sourdough hamburger buns are easy to make with your sourdough starter and a few simple ingredients. Mix the dough in the morning and bake them fresh for dinner the same day!

**PREP TIME:** 10 minutes
**COOK TIME:** 30 minutes
**RISING TIME:** 6 hours

## INGREDIENTS

### Sourdough Starter

- 2 teaspoons (10 g) unfed sourdough starter
- 3 tablespoons (25 g) all-purpose flour
- 5 teaspoons (25 g) water

### Dough Ingredients

- ¼ cup (50 g) active sourdough starter
- 3 cups (360 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (240 g) water
- 1 ½ tablespoons (30 g) honey
- 1 ½ teaspoons (10 g) salt

### Egg Wash

- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon water
- Sesame seeds (optional topping)

## Sample Baking Schedule

- **FEED YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER - 8 PM**
- **MIX THE DOUGH - 8 AM**
- **STRETCH AND FOLD - 8:30 AM**
- **FIRST RISE - 9:30-3:30 PM\***
- **DIVIDE AND SHAPE - 3:30 PM**
- **BAKE - ~4:30-5:00 for 25 Minutes @ 375°F**

## INSTRUCTIONS

**FEED YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER**

- 12 hours before you plan to mix the dough, add the ingredients to make ¼ cup (50 g) of active sourdough starter to a clean jar. Stir until combined, loosely cover the jar, and let the starter rise at room temperature. The sourdough starter is ready to use when it has doubled in size and there are plenty of bubbles on the surface and sides of the jar.
- (The ingredients will create a total of 60 g active starter, but some of it will stick to the sides of the jar during the transfer, so we are making a little more than needed.)

**MIX THE DOUGH**

- Add the ingredients to a large mixing bowl and use a spatula or your hands to mix them together until there are no dry bits in the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest on the counter for 30 minutes.

**PERFORM 3 SETS OF STRETCH AND FOLDS**

- Wet your hand with a little water to prevent sticking. Pick up the dough on one side and stretch it up and over itself. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat this step until you have turned the bowl a full circle. The dough should form into a tight ball.
- Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
- Repeat the stretch and fold process two more times.

**FIRST RISE**

- Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise until doubled. (This took 6 hours in my 72°F (22°C) kitchen.)
- After the dough has doubled, you can place the dough in the fridge for up to 2 days to bake them later OR proceed to the next step. See notes.

**SHAPE AND SECOND RISE**

- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions of 112-115 grams each.
- Working with one portion at a time, shape the dough into a ball. Lightly flour the top of the dough and then place it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough.
- Cover the sheet with a clean kitchen towel and allow the buns to rise at room temperature until puffy, 1-2 hours.

**BAKE**

- Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Mix the egg with the water in a small bowl and lightly brush the top of each dough ball. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top if desired. Bake for 25 minutes or until the buns are golden brown.
- Remove the buns from the oven and allow them to cool before slicing.
