# SOURDOUGH CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES RECIPE

[Source](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe/)

**PREP TIME:** 10 minutes
**COOK TIME:** 15 minutes
**CHILL TIME:** 2 hours
**TOTAL TIME:** 2 hours 25 minutes
**SERVINGS:** 12
**AUTHOR:** AMY DUSKA

## INGREDIENTS

### DRY INGREDIENTS

- ¾ cup + 1 teaspoon (95 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup + 1 teaspoon (125 g) bread flour (all-purpose can be substituted, see notes)
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) fine sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder

### WET INGREDIENTS 1

- 1 large (1) egg
- ½ cup (125 g) sourdough starter (discard)
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) vanilla extract

### WET INGREDIENTS 2

- 8 tablespoons (113 g) unsalted butter (cold, cubed)
- ½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar
- ½ cup (100 g) white granulated sugar
- 1 ½ cups (340 g) chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)

## BAKING INSTRUCTIONS

### MIX DRY INGREDIENTS

1. Use a whisk or a fork to mix the bread flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

### MIX WET INGREDIENTS 1

2. In a separate small bowl, use a whisk or a fork to beat the egg, vanilla extract, and sourdough starter until smooth. Set aside.

### MIX WET INGREDIENTS 2

3. Place the cold, cubed butter, light brown sugar, and granulated sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Beat on low-speed until the mixture forms small crumbles, 45-60 seconds. Add the chocolate chips and mix on low-speed 30-45 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
4. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low-speed until the batter starts to become a crumbly mixture, 20-30 seconds. Pour in the egg mixture and mix on low-speed until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 20-30 seconds. Use a spatula to stir the batter, ensuring all of the ingredients have been fully incorporated.
5. Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough into 12 balls (2 scoops per cookie) and place them on a parchment-lined baking tray. Cover the dough with a sheet of plastic wrap so they do not dry out. Chill the dough in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours (24 hours is best!).
6. Bake in a preheated, 375°F (190°C) oven for 15-17 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center still appears slightly under-baked. Remove and allow the cookies to rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

## INSTRUCTIONS

In order to create a soft and chewy sourdough chocolate chip cookie, the batter must NOT be over-mixed.

After several test batches, we found that the following method worked best for incorporating the ingredients without overmixing the dough.

To achieve this, use the paddle attachment with a stand mixer to beat cold, cubed butter with the sugars until it starts to come together, 45-60 seconds. The mixture will be thick and uneven looking.

Add the chocolate chips and continue to beat on low speed for 30 seconds. The texture of the chocolate chips will help blend the butter and sugar together evenly. (We are not looking for light and fluffy.)

Whisk the dry ingredients together in a small bowl and add them to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until it has a "crumbly" texture, 20-30 seconds.

Use a fork to beat the egg, sourdough discard, and vanilla in a small bowl. Add it to the batter and mix on low speed until "just incorporated," 20-30 seconds.

Use a spatula to make sure the ingredients are fully combined.

The goal is to avoid over-mixing the batter so that you get a thick, chewy, perfect cookie!

Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough into 12 large balls. Place them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and chill in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours (24 hours is best!).

When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Bake the cookies for 15-17 minutes, or until the outside of the cookies are golden brown and the middle still looks slightly under-baked.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

## TIPS AND TRICKS

- After each addition of ingredients to the stand mixer, mix until "just incorporated." You do not want to add any air to the batter. Adding too much air creates a more "cake-like" cookie.

- Bread flour is higher in gluten, which produces a more chewy cookie. If you don't have bread flour, you can use all-purpose flour in its place.

- Enhance the flavor of the cookie with flaked sea salt. Add a pinch on top of the dough balls before you place them in the oven. (This is totally optional but highly recommended!)

## NOTES

- Store baked cookies at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 7 days. Place a small slice of white bread inside the container to help keep cookies fresh.

- Freeze unbaked dough for up to 3 months.

- Bread flour can be replaced with equal parts all-purpose flour. Using 100% all-purpose flour will produce a less chewy cookie.
