**PREP TIME:** 20 minutes
**COOK TIME:** 8 minutes
**TOTAL TIME:** 1 day 28 minutes
**SERVINGS:** 10

## INGREDIENTS

### INGREDIENTS TO MAKE ½ CUP (100 G) OF ACTIVE SOURDOUGH STARTER

- 1 tablespoon (15 g) sourdough starter
- ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon (50 g) all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ tablespoons (50 g) water

### DOUGH INGREDIENTS

- ½ cup (100 g) active sourdough starter
- 1 tablespoon (20 g) honey, sugar, or maple syrup
- 1 cup (240 g) milk
- 3 cups (360 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) fine sea salt
- ¼ cup (40 g) cornmeal for sprinkling

## INSTRUCTIONS

### FEED YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER

1. 12 hours before you plan to mix the dough, add the ingredients to make ½ cup (100 g) of active sourdough starter to a clean jar. Stir until combined, loosely cover the jar, and let the starter rise at room temperature. (The ingredients will create a total of 115 g active starter, but, because some of it will stick to the sides of the jar during the transfer, we are making a little more than needed.) The sourdough starter is ready to use when it has doubled in size and there are plenty of bubbles on the surface and sides of the jar.

### MAKE THE DOUGH

2. Add 100g of the active starter and the rest of the ingredients (except cornmeal) to a large bowl and use your hands to mix until well combined. Cover and let rest 30-60 minutes.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5 minutes. (A stand mixer with a dough hook attachment can be used on the lowest speed.)
4. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let ferment on the counter at room temperature 8-12 hours. (Room temperature is 65-70°F)

### CUT AND COOK

5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, flour the top of the dough, and press it out using your fingertips until it is 1" in thickness.
6. Use a 3" biscuit cutter to cut rounds and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet that's been sprinkled with cornmeal. Sprinkle the tops with cornmeal, cover with a tea towel, and allow to rise for 1 hour at room temperature.
7. Preheat your non-stick skillet over LOW heat. Place 4 muffins into the skillet spaced 2" apart, cover, and cook the first side for 4 minutes. Turn the muffins over and cook for an additional 4 minutes. (When done, the center of a muffin should register about 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.)

## STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

These sourdough English muffins are simple to make, so let's dive straight into the details!

1. Feed your sourdough starter 12 hours prior to mixing dough so that it's active and bubbly.

2. In a medium-sized bowl, mix all of the ingredients together with your hands until they are fully combined. Cover the bowl and let rest for 30-60 minutes.

3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes with your hands. (This step can also be done in a stand mixer, using a dough hook, on low speed for 5 minutes.)

4. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let rise at room temperature for 8-12 hours at 65-70 degrees. (It will double in size.)

5. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, flour the top of it, and press it out to a 1" thickness, using your fingertips.

6. Cut out 3" rounds and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet that's been sprinkled with cornmeal.

7. Sprinkle the tops with cornmeal. Cover with a tea towel and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour.

8. Preheat a non-stick skillet over LOW heat. Place 4 muffins into the skillet, making sure there is 2" of space in between each one. Cover and cook for 4 minutes per side. (No need to add oil to the pan before cooking.)

9. Place the muffins back onto the parchment paper to cool before slicing them in half.
