## Instructions

### Feed Your Sourdough Starter

1. 12 hours before you plan to mix the dough, add the ingredients to make ¼ cup (50 g) of active sourdough starter to a clean jar. Stir until combined, loosely cover the jar and let the starter rise at room temperature.
   - (The ingredients will create a total of 60 g active starter but some of it will stick to the sides of the jar during the transfer, so we are making a little more than needed.)
2. The sourdough starter is ready to use when it has doubled in size and there are plenty of bubbles on the surface and sides of the jar.

### Make the Dough

1. **Mix the dough:** Transfer 50 g of the active starter and 350 g water into a large mixing bowl. Stir to distribute the starter evenly. Add 500 g bread flour and 10 g sea salt to the bowl and use a stiff spatula or your hands to work the ingredients together until it forms a shaggy mass and there are no dry bits of flour left in the bowl.
2. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for one hour at room temperature.

### Stretch and Fold

1. Wet your hand with a little water to prevent sticking. Pick up the dough on one side and stretch it up and over itself. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat this step until you have turned the bowl a full circle. The dough should form into a tight ball.
2. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
3. Repeat the stretch and fold process one more time to help build volume in the final loaf.

### Bulk Fermentation

1. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 7-10 hours on your kitchen counter. The dough will have risen by about 50-75%, not doubled, when it is ready to shape.
   - (If the dough has doubled in size and/or is hard to shape, it may be over-proofed. Reduce the rising time on your next bake.)

### Shape and Second Rise

1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a ball by pulling 4 sides of the dough into the middle of itself. Turn the dough over so that it is seam-side down.
2. Use your hands to gently cup the dough, pulling and twisting towards yourself until it forms a tight skin on the outside.
3. Center the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, seam-side down. Use the parchment paper like a sling to lift the dough up and transfer it into a medium-sized bowl.
4. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let the dough rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
5. Use your thumb to make an indentation in the dough about a ½ inch deep. If the indentation quickly springs back all the way, or almost all the way, it's under-proofed and still needs more time to rise.

### Score and Bake

1. 30 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat the oven, with the Dutch oven inside, to 450°F (232°C).
2. Using long silicone gloves, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven and take the lid off.
3. Score the top of the dough with a razor or a sharp knife. Once again, use the parchment paper as a sling to lift the dough up and transfer it into the Dutch oven.
4. Place the lid on the Dutch oven, return it to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and bake an additional 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
   - (The internal temperature of the bread should be around 205-210°F (96-99°C) using a digital food thermometer.)

### Cool

Transfer the baked bread to a cooling rack for 1-2 hours before slicing. The bread will continue to cook inside during this time. If you slice into it too soon, it will result in a gummy loaf.

### Store

Keep the bread at room temperature, in a bread bag, wrapped in a kitchen towel or beeswax wrap. You can also store the bread, cut-side down, on a cutting board with a cake-stand top covering the bread. Do not refrigerate.

### Freeze

Freeze full loaves or individual slices wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and inserted into a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months.

### Serve

Nothing beats the taste of warm sourdough bread slathered with homemade butter, unless it's homemade Nutella or strawberry jam!

## Notes

- This recipe was tested in a 68°F (20°C) kitchen. If your kitchen is colder, rising times will take longer and if it's warmer, less time.
- If using all-purpose flour reduce water to 325g. Add more if necessary during the first set of stretch and folds.
- This bread can be baked in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. After the first rise, shape the dough, place it seam-side down into the loaf pan and allow it to rise. Bake the loaf in a 375°F (190°C) oven for 45 minutes or until the internal temperature is 190°F (88°C).

# How to Make Easy Sourdough Bread: Details Instructions

Before we dive into the details, let's take a look at the basic steps you will take to prepare a basic loaf of sourdough bread.

1. **Feed Your Sourdough Starter and Let It Rise Until Doubled.**
   - About 12 hours before you plan to mix the dough, to a clean jar add:
     - 10 grams unfed starter
     - 25 grams water
     - 25 grams flour
   - Cover the jar loosely and allow it to rest at room temperature.

   This small ratio of unfed sourdough starter mixed with flour and water should take anywhere from 8-12 hours to double in size depending on the temperature of your kitchen.

2. **Mix the Dough and Let It Rest for 1 Hour at Room Temperature.**
   - Once the starter has doubled in size, transfer it to a large bowl along with 350 grams of water.
   - Stir the two together with a stiff spatula to distribute the starter evenly in the water.
   - Next, add 500 grams of bread flour and 10 grams of sea salt to the bowl.
   - Use the spatula or your hands to work the ingredients together until it forms a shaggy mass.
   - Make sure to work any dry bits stuck to the sides of the bowl into the dough.
   - Cover the bowl with a silicone bowl cover, a beeswax cloth, or a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 1 hour on the counter.

   This resting period is also referred to as "autolyse." During this hour, the dough will absorb the water, making it easier to work with.

3. **Perform 2 Sets of Stretch and Folds 30 Minutes Apart.**
   - Once the hour is up, perform two sets of stretch and folds to the dough spaced 30 minutes apart.
   - This process will add strength to the dough and help with the gluten development.

4. **Bulk Fermentation (First Rise)**
   - After the second set of stretch and folds, cover the bowl and let the dough ferment for 7-10 hours on your kitchen counter.
   - The dough is ready for the next step when it has risen by about 50-75% in size.
   - If your kitchen is warmer, start checking it after 3-4 hours to make sure it doesn't over-proof.
   - If the dough over-proofs and becomes sticky and hard to shape, you can refrigerate it to firm up. It can stay in the fridge for up to 2 days.

5. **Shape and Second Rise**
   - Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
   - Shape the dough into a ball by pulling 4 sides of the dough up and into the middle of itself.
   - Turn the dough over so that the seam-side is down.
   - Gently cup the dough, pulling and twisting until it forms a tight skin with surface tension on the outside of the dough ball.
   - Center the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, seam-side down. Use the parchment paper as a sling to lift the dough up and into a bowl.
   - Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 1-2 hours.

6. **Preheat Oven with a Dutch Oven Inside**
   - 30 minutes before the dough is ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C), with the empty Dutch oven inside.
   - A Dutch oven acts like a commercial steam oven by trapping the steam from the dough during the first 20 minutes of baking. This steam helps to produce a good "oven spring" or rise to the bread.

7. **Score and Bake**
   - Once the dough is ready, use a bread lame or a sharp razor blade to create a 2-3 inch slash on the top of the dough.
   - Wearing a pair of heavy silicone gloves, remove the Dutch oven from the oven and take off the lid.
   - Use the parchment paper that the dough is sitting in as a sling to carefully lift it out of the bowl and transfer it to the Dutch oven.
   - Place the lid back onto the Dutch oven, return it to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes.
   - Remove the lid and bake uncovered for an additional 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
   - A more accurate way to check that the bread has finished baking is to take the internal temperature with a digital food thermometer. It should register somewhere in the range of 205-210°F (96-99°C) when it is done.
   - Let the bread cool on a cooling rack for 1-2 hours before slicing to prevent it from becoming gummy.

## Tips for Success
