# Chocolate Chip Sourdough Scones

**PREP TIME:** 10 minutes
**COOK TIME:** 27 minutes
**CHILLING TIME:** 30 minutes

## INGREDIENTS

### DRY INGREDIENTS

- 2 cups + 2 teaspoons (250 g) all-purpose flour
- ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) fine sea salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 stick (113 g) unsalted butter, frozen or very cold
- 1 cup (180 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

### WET INGREDIENTS

- ½ cup (125 g) sourdough starter discard
- 1 large egg
- 2 teaspoons (10 g) vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) heavy cream (milk or half and half can be used)

### TOPPING

- 2 tablespoons (30 g) heavy cream (milk or half and half can be used)
- 3 tablespoons (45 g) sanding sugar (coarse sugar)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together.
2. Use a cheese grater to grate the butter into the bowl.
3. Toss the grated butter with the flour mixture using a fork to coat and separate the pieces of butter.
4. Cut the flour into the butter using a pastry cutter or a bench scraper until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs.
5. Add the chocolate chips to the mixture and stir.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk the starter, egg, vanilla extract, and heavy cream until smooth.
7. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a fork to gently mix. The dough will be crumbly, resist the urge to add more liquid.
8. Dump the dough onto a clean work surface and use your hands to press and shape the dough into an 8" disc shape. Use a small amount of flour if needed to prevent sticking to the surface.
9. Cut the dough into 8 wedges using a bench scraper or a large knife.
10. Arrange the wedges on a parchment-lined baking sheet with space in between each wedge.
11. Place the baking sheet in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.
12. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C).
13. Brush the top of the scones with heavy cream and sprinkle with sanding sugar.
14. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the scones are golden brown.
15. Remove and serve warm.
